# **Requirements**
-------------
- Scene Types: There is a main title scene, credits scene, gameplay scene, and a menu settings bar on the main title scene

- Communication between scenes: After watching the logo once, the game will remember that and will not show it to you again. It will also load the title scene without any fade-ins, communicating the state to it. (You can press the spacebar on the title screen to reset the localStorage) Look under src/logo.js at like 15 and src/intro.js at like 291

- Reachability: All screens are reachable by clicking on different buttons, play, credits, and options respectively 

- Transitions: There are coordinated fades between all of the scenes.
